            The above picture was clicked by me on my DSLR last year. The picture shown has Lord Shiva, his wife Goddess Parvati, and their son Lord Ganesh riding on their ride Nandi accompanied by their elder son Kartikeya and Naradji. <br/>
            The picture was shot in the city of Vadodara in India where the marriage of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati is celebrated yearly on the day of Maha Shivratri by taking out their idols and taking the round of the city. This symbolises 
            that god occasionally takes rounds of the cities to see how the common people and devotees are doing.
